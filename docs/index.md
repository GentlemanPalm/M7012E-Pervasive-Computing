Welcome to our glorious website that is committed to enlight you as a reader about the possibilities and opportunities to enrich and cultivate young minds with new technologies and gadgets. 

# First encounter / The origins
The original idea for this project evolved from the idea of facilitating education for young adults and how it can be achieved by using new and existing technologies. In order to get started with this project, a task specification has to be acquired and a strategy has to be conceived. For the first part (sprint) of the development of the project the idea was to look at some frameworks and hardware that supports Leap Motion, which is the leading role in sensors for hand tracking. Since the development and deployment of new software called Orion(2016), Leap motion has now support and capabilites to deploy their solutions in VR. The suggested hardware that is currently supported is the following: Oculus rift, Oculus go, HTC vive and HTC vive PRO. The selected hardware will be based on compatibility, portability, deployability, simplicity and usability. The next part that requires attention is the selection of compatible 3D modeling tool set that has the support for virtual reality. Currently supported game engines are the following: Unity, Unreal Engine. More to come... /relaxz   

# Short delays
Due to small delayes in arrival of the hardware and few deadlines on the course, the project took a snooze. Preperations were made to have the project in full swing by Monday the 20th of November via research on the desired game engine, tools and content. While we are waiting for the arrival of the needed hardware, the task is to run tutorials on the game engines and working on the project paper and presentation. /relaxz

# Project paper and presentation
Due to lack of work we now have an IEEE formatted Overleaf document which needs to be filled with content and a presentation which is 80% done. /relaxz    

# Video editing tools
Found a cool video editing tool called Lightworks which appears to be free. Played around with it and it seems work just fine for what it is intended, a promotion video. Now only to construct an idea! /relaxz
